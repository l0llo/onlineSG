onlineSG is a library for modeling Security Games. It is built around two main classes: *Game* and *Player*.

*Game* contains all the data and the logic related to the Game Theory beneath the SG.

*Player* is the base class for all the player classes that represent the various types of agents that can interact in a SG.
